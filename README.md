## Acknowledgments

I want to give a shout out to the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) CEO and professor, [Per Harald Borgen](https://twitter.com/perborgen). I have recently finished the [HTML and CSS course](https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss) in Scrimba and the things I learned there helped me a lot and enabled me to finish this challenge in less than 30 minutes.
